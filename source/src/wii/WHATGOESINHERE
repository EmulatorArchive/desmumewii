The Wii folder should be a port/rewrite of the Windows folder.

#includes in the source will then need to be changed to link to the Wii folder
instead of the Windows folder.

For the record, the Windows folder is basically the GUI for desmume and uses
the source in the src folder to emulate roms. The Windows folder also contains
source for things we don't neeed (and shouldn't want) like gameplay video recording.
