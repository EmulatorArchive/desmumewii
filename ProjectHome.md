## What is DeSmuME Wii? ##
This project aims to port DeSmuME to Wii homebrew so that we can have a fully fledged, working, Nintendo DS emulator on Wii. It is being built with DeSmuME 0.95 and the latest available devkitPPC and libogc releases. Please see the links in the sidebar on the right for more information.
