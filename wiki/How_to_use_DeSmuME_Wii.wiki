*This page describes how to use the emulator DeSmuME Wii.*

= Set-up on your SD Card =

Goto the downloads page and download the latest .dol

Rename it to boot.dol

Place it in your SD Card in sd:/apps/desmumewii/boot.dol

Most likely, you will get a black frozen inescapable screen. If this occurs, unplug your Wii.

Right now, it appears that no ROMs work but not very many have been tested. As we work on the emulator, we will frequently update the build available for download. Please let us know immediately if you get a ROM to work.
